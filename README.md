This function implements the Olley-Pakes Productivity Growth Decomposition, for Stata. Specifically, it decomposes aggregate productivity growth between any pair of consecutive periods into the contribution of surviving firms, 
exiting firms and entering firms in the spirit of Olley and Pakes (1992), Melitz and Polanec (2015) and Dias and Robalo Marques
(2021). Furthermore, it splits the contribution of surviving firms into a market share reallocation effect and an unweigthed productivity 
component.
